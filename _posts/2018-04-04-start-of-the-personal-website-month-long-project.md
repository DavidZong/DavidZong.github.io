### The beginning of a personal website
I am making a website and this is the blog portion of it. A couple of weeks ago I was getting over a fairly nasty cold by staying home and doing as little as possible. I was watching [Day[9] stream Hearthstone](https://www.twitch.tv/day9tv) on his Twitch channel. He challenged his viewers to plan a month long project. The month long project will be from April 4th, 2018 to May 4th, 2018. So having no functional personal site of my own, I will use the next month to work on a passable personal site.

### Desired Features of the Personal Site
* A full CV, with links, so anyone interested in my work can find more info
* A short blurb about myself, with some pictures
* This blog, which can be written in Markdown and quickly updated with little effort (should be easy with Jekyll)
* Links to various other academic / professional things that I do, and other pages I have on the internet

### Desired Outcomes
* Familiarity with HTML, CSS, Jekyll
* Using Git more than I have in the past
* Having a website that people visit

At the end of the month sometime after May 4th, I'll post another blog about how I did.
