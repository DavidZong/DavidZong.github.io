	<p>Hi, I do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_biology">synthetic biology</a> research in <a href="http://biodesign.rice.edu/">Matthew Bennett's group</a>  at Rice University. This is my website that has some information about me. I also make blog posts sometimes if I feel like I have something interesting to say. This website is currently under construction, but I hope to get a decent version up by May 2018.</p>
