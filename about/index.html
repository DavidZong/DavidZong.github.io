	<h1>About Myself</h1>
	<p><i>Hello, I am David Zong. I am currently a Ph.D. Student at Rice University in Houston, Texas.</i></p>
	<p>I was born in Seattle, Washington and grew up in the greater Seattle area. I went to school at the University of Washington and majored in Bioengineering. I focused on synthetic biology research and was a member of the Washington <a href="http://igem.org/Main_Page">iGEM</a> team (check out our projects: <a href="http://2010.igem.org/Team:Washington">2010</a>, <a href="http://2011.igem.org/Team:Washington">2011-Winner!</a>, <a href="http://2012.igem.org/Team:Washington">2012</a>). I was also an undergraduate researcher in the <a href="http://klavinslab.org/">Klavins Lab</a> where I worked on a project about engineering <i>E. coli</i> to eat plant matter.</p>
	<p>I moved to Houston to attend Rice in the <a href="https://sspb.rice.edu/">Systems, Synthetic, and Physical Biology Ph.D. program.</a> At Rice, I've continued to research synthetic biology with Prof. Matt Bennett in the <a href="http://biodesign.rice.edu/">Biodesign Lab</a>. My current research focuses on how to engineer dynamic circuits in populations of <i>E. coli</i>.</p>
